# BlockDataMarket
A solution for a Data Market on Blockchain made for Computer Engineering Laboratory class.

This project presents a possible solution for implementing a data market platform on top of Blockchain technology. The platform aims to map the market dynamics in a competitive demand / offer scenario when buying and selling data.

In order to produce a virtual market, we built **Chaincode** which represents the transaction logic that runs inside the Blockchain network. We also built an **External Application** which explores the network and helps it work with some market events. Finally, we also built a **Demo** that simulates the interaction of customers with the data market, simulating all possible market dynamics, with real and expected behaviors.

This project was carried out in the second semester of the fourth year of informatics engineering course at University of Minho. [2019-2020]
